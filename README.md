# TripAdvisor-Scoring Reviewer
The dataset used in this project includes quantitative and categorical features from online reviews of 21 hotels located in Las Vegas Strip, extracted from TripAdvisor. All the 504 reviews were collected between January and August of 2015.

The dataset contains 504 records and 20 tuned features, 24 per hotel (two per each month, randomly selected), regarding the year of 2015. The CSV contains a header, with the names of the columns corresponding to the features

Headers corresponding to each column has categorical variables which have text labels but most machine learning algorithms in python accept data with numeric labels only therefore we'll be encoding the categorical variables to numeric labels
